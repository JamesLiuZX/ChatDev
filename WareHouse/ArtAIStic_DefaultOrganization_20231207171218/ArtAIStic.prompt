We allow commercializat
ion of generative AI generated artwork. Using replicate as the base model 
API, we allow users to choose from preset styles to generate a prompt-base
d artwork, or they can upload 3-5 images to train their own models, fine-t
une the SDXL on replicate and save that as their unique style. After the a
rtwork is generated, they can export it to e-commerce platforms like Shopi
fy and Etsy, where they can then integrate with 3rd party applications lik
e Printify to fulfill 3D printed products of that design, such as posters,
 gifts, phone cases, shirts, etc.
